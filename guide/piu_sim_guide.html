                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        In terms of rhythm games, a <strong>simulator</strong> is a program that <strong>simulates</strong> the gameplay loop and mechanics of a given game.
                        Simulators are generally free to play, and can either look entirely unique, or can visually resemble the game they're made to simulate.
                    </p>
                </span>

                <h2 class="body-header">Drawbacks of Using a Simulator</h2>
                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        Simulators are built from the ground up to resemble the gameplay and mirror the core mechanics of a particular game.
                        They're rarely (if ever) perfect, and most have noticeable flaws that can detract from the experience. <strong>This is true of all simulators.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to <em>Pump it Up</em> simulators specifically, the question of chart accuracy also comes into play. Most charts <strong>from 1st Dance Floor</strong> up to and <strong>including PRIME 2015</strong> are <strong>decrypts</strong>.
                        Decrypt charts are near identical to the originals, as they were converted to a simfile format from decrypted data originating from the official game. Everything <strong>including and after PRIME 2 2017</strong> are <strong>recreations</strong> made by hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll go into more detail regarding simfiles, as well as particular pros and cons for each commonly used simulator, further down this page.

                        Here's a (roughly) chronological list of modern, commonly used ones that you'll see mentioned frequently online. Every one has different quirks and features, which I'll be covering later.

                    The following is paraphrased and summarized from my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dj505/recommended/2756930">Steam review</a> for <em>Pump it Up: R!SE</em> from the perspective of a long-time arcade player and fan of the franchise.
                    I may have updated it since adding it to this page (July 24, 2025). I know it's a little long, but do bear with me if you're interested in this one at all; everything below still holds true, and if you're still unsure, feel free to check out the full, unedited review itself on Steam for more info!
                </p>
                <br />
                <summary>
                    <p>
                        If you're interested in <em>R!SE</em> whatsoever, you've probably heard about the changes it made to some core mechanics, like the introduction of hold head timing, new scoring calculations, and various tweaks to the charts to make them more keyboard/controller friendly.
                        A lot of these changes are really controversial to a lot of players who want an exact arcade port at home, but <strong>this isn't that - and that's a really good thing!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>If you're going into this expecting or wanting a game that's mechanically and visually 1:1 with the arcade series, you're going to be disappointed.</strong>
                        But what you'll be getting instead is a game <strong>specially crafted for home players,</strong> with a new visual style and a tried & true UI/UX for PC rhythm gaming.
                        <strong>All of the changes made to the content and mechanics in RISE feel like they've actually been thought through, and it shows.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I happen to own official <em>Prime 2</em> and <em>XX</em> arcade kits at home, as well as dedicated keyboard-style hand controllers that work with them. Obviously anyone who plays this way will have different experiences and opinions than my own; however, while it was interesting and novel at first, it's clear that the arcade versions are not well balanced for hand controllers, despite being a ton of fun and very satisfying on pad.
                        It ranges from just not really being challenging at all, to being frustratingly difficult in a way that isn't fun, without much in between. The timing and hold mechanics are too forgiving to make passing more straightforward charts feel satisfying. More complex charts with advanced patterns can be super uncomfortable to execute, especially if you play spread (i.e. SDF JKL).
                        <strong>RISE manages to solve just about all of these problems</strong> by taking what didn't work for hand play in the arcade version, and tweaking it to keep it challenging <em>and</em> fun regardless of your skill level with a dance pad.
                    </p>

                        Everything flows really, really well. It really does feel amazing to play. Even the new RISE originals are charted in a way that still <em>feels</em> like the arcade content I know and love, while remaining satisfying on keyboard and controller.
                        The timing windows feel nice and snappy, and while it's hard for me to tell if they made them much tighter, it's still very satisfying without making trickier patterns frustrating to execute.
                        Requiring accurate hits on holds keeps the flow going, without weird breaks where you can just hold down all the buttons to win. The letter grade after a song actually feels representative of how I felt I performed accuracy-wise.
                        It all just <em>works,</em> and it <em>still feels like I'm playing Pump it Up!</em>

                        If you're on the fence about this one, give it a try, and keep an open mind. If you really don't like it or it's not what you want out of a home port, that's totally fine, Steam's refund policy has your back. You'll know within 2 hours whether it's right for you.
                        <strong>Andamiro really made something special here, and if you can see the vision, then I think you'll have a fantastic time with this game!</strong>
                        The fact that they could make Pump it Up accessible to anyone, without the need for an arcade-size dance pad, while still keeping the soul of the game intact, is genuinely impressive.

                    <em>R!SE</em> is an early access title, and while it's not perfect, they've already shown a strong dedication to listening to user feedback, and it's only going to get better with time.
                    In the first week alone, they posted several developer notes in their official Discord to engage with players, detailed what fixed they had planned, and released patches (usually within 24-48 hours!) to address the issues that the community brought up.
                    Not just bug fixes either, but mechanical changes that players actively expressed wanting to see, like the ability to turn off the low-pass filter on a miss, or making hold tails less brutally punishing for early releases.

                    <strong>Andamiro didn't have to do this for us, but they did.</strong> This game was made for the community, for the fans, and the fact that it happened at all is miraculous.

                <p>
                    StepMania was released in 2001 as a simulator for Konami's <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> games. Over time, the codebase was expanded to add support for other gamemodes, including Pump.
                    Every other simulator listed below is built on top of some version of StepMania 5.x, with extremely thorough and heavy-handed changes to fix bugs, issues, and inaccuracies, as well as to add features not present in the base StepMania 5.x engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Base StepMania (versions 4.x through 5.x) are <strong>not recommended</strong> for Pump simulation due to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issues with hold notes and ticks not being counted or scored correctly;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heds are subject to full tap note timing windows instead of just Perfect or Miss;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heads cannot be held before reaching the receptors to count as a Perfect;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate timing window scales;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate lifebar mechanics;</li>
                    <li>A lack of support for special notetypes widely used in Pump charts for visual effects, etc;</li>
                    <li>An overall lack of maintainence regarding the "pump" gamemode, with no updates or fixes in a very long time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While custom charts made with these mechanics in mind do exist, they are exceptiomally rare, and the vast majority of players are not looking for this playstyle.
                    <strong>Chart files made for other StepMania-based simulators will technically play</strong> in this engine, but <strong>they will not work correctly.</strong>
                    <strong>Most official chart conversions are not playable</strong> on this engine.

                    StepF2 is the first major modern Pump simulator to have been released.
                    It is an accurate recreation of <em>Pump it Up: Fiesta 2</em>, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game.
                    For many years, it was the most popular and widely used simulator available, and it defined the chart format still used by most modern simulators today.
                    You basically have StepF2 to thank for the existence of most other modern simulators and content!

                    StepF2 is <strong>playable</strong>, performs well, and still holds up, but is <strong>deprecated</strong>, as it has been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1">StepP1</a> (which has, in turn, been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1+">StepP1+</a>).

                    StepPrime is weird. There are a lot of rumors to how this one started and where it originated. There are a lot of different projects that called themselves "StepPrime" and the history is really muddled. This will be <strong>focusing on the StepPrime released by the late PumpSanity team.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know if StepPrime ever made it past the early alpha stage, but from my experience, it was very buggy and incomplete, though it's been long enough that I don't remember the specifics.
                    It was functional, but definitely not the ideal experience. Most people I've talked to who tried it had a similar experience.
                    It's easy enough to find references to it floating around the internet that I figure it's worth a mention in this list, but it's not worth seeking out.

                <p>
                    Infinitesimal is a theme for the <a href="https://projectoutfox.com/" target="_blank">Project OutFox</a> engine, formerly known as StepMania 5.3.
                    The visual style is inspired heavily by <em>Pump it Up: Infinity</em>, and the base game itself does not include any <em>Pump it Up</em> branding or copyrighted content.
                    I started developing Infinitesimal in May of 2020.
                    It gained traction over time as more contributors jumped on board, and as OutFox improved the "pump" gamemode engine, ironing out bugs and implementing new features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a while, OutFox was not as viable for Pump simulation due to long-standing problems with StepF2-style warps and issues with hold notes.
                    As of November 28, 2024, the latest Alpha V test build fixed these issues.
                    Warps and effects in charts like Conflict S22 will no longer instantly kill you, combos are counted accurately throughout effects, and most (if not all) charts previously considered unplayably work flawlessly.
                    Accuracy will improve with time too, given this software is only in the alpha stage, and Infinitesimal will be bundled directly with future OutFox releases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project aims to recreate as much Pump functionality as possible plus tons of extra goodies, including but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arcade-accurate, asymmetrical timing</li>
                    <li>All timing window options available in PIU, plus extras</li>
                    <li>Arcade-accurate lifebar with overflow</li>
                    <li>Several types of speed mods, including arcade-accurate AV</li>
                    <li>Options for classic or Phoenix-style scoring, letter grades & plates</li>
                    <li>Chart previews on the difficulty select menu</li>
                    <li>Options for experienced players (visualize lifebar overflow, accuracy, etc)
                    <li>All original UI/menu graphics and music</li>

                    <li>Pay mode support for fully legal public use (assuming you have the license or permission to use any added songs)</li>
                </ul>

                    However, many major features were implemented by knowledgeable contributors, without whom it would not exist the way it does today!

                    StepP1 is the official successor to <a href="#StepF2">StepF2</a>.
                    It is a mostly accurate recreation of <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em>, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game.
                    StepP1 was never fully completed and lacks features like basic mode, but being a continuation of StepF2's already rock solid engine, it holds up well and gameplay is very accurate.
                    It only received one release, and is no longer being developed or maintained. There will be no future updates released by the original developer.

                <p><span class="label-red">Deprecated</span></p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX is the successor to <a href="#StepPrime">StepPrime</a>, developed by the late PumpSanity team, made to resemble <em>Pump it Up: XX 20th Anniversary Edition</em>.
                    Not to be confused with StepXX, a different simulator also meant to resemble <em>Pump it Up: XX</em>, but never made it past extremely early development and was never quite playable.
                    <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> has not been decrypted, and the graphics used are a mix of hand recreations and cropped sections from other media.
                    Many sound effects and menu tracks don't quite line up, or suffer from poor audio quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX received infrequent updates and never really made it past the "early preview" stage, with a permanent watermark on the upper left corner.
                    There were some attempts to implement an online matching feature, but it seems they were limited to a private build that was only distributed selectively, and I'm not sure it got a public release.
                    StepPXX introduced a <strong>new simfile format</strong>, which accounted for some new modifiers that StepP1 did not support, but which rarely see widespread use.
                    This new simfile format is an SSC versoin that is <strong>not compatible with StepP1</strong> or any simulators made to use StepP1 simfiles, which pushed StepPXX simfiles into their own separate branch of the simulator community,
                    starting a content accessibility divide that is still present today. Performance is also subpar on lower end machines, due to the security and encryption features present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first widespread simulator to include support for Mission or Quest zones from older mainline <em>Pump it Up</em> games,
                    including the mission zones from <em>Pump it Up: Infinity</em> and <em>Fiesta EX</em>, and WorldMax from <em>Pump it Up NXA</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other simulators themed around official releases, <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> was still actively supported and sold by Andamiro during the time of this project's release.
                    Many freeplay arcades opted to install this software instead of purchasing a legitimate kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX is <strong>deprecated</strong> and succeeded by <a href="#PumpSanity">PumpSanity</a>.

                    Oh boy, this one's got some history. Buckle up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity is the successor to <a href="#StepPXX">StepPXX</a>, developed by the late PumpSanity team.
                    Its main attraction is the new "original" PumpSanity theme, which is primarily a reskin of the Prime theme with some extras added on.
                    It also includes options for <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em> and <em>XX: 20th Anniversary Edition</em> themes, recycled from StepPrime and StepPXX respectively, with some fixes and improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity received infrequent updates, and some content was <strong>paywalled behind their Patreon page</strong>.
                    One big selling point for PumpSanity was its online matching feature, which differed from StepPXX's implementation by working via Discord integration, and requiring the player to be present in the official PumpSanity discord server to work.
                    This feature no longer functions, and <strong>will cause the game to crash</strong> after finishing a song unless the player either closes Discord or blocks the application in the Windows Firewall settings.
                    PumpSanity also continued and expanded upon their <strong>new simfile format</strong>, further branching off from StepF2's long-standing standard and widening the content accessibility divide; any charts made for PumpSanity will not function correctly in any other simulator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the game's built-in content was taken from the <a href="#StepF2">StepF2</a>/<a href="#StepP1">StepP1</a> projects and redistributed with minor changes to fit the new engine.
                    Other content was used without permission, such as simfile transcriptions (which I personally contributed to) meant to preserve the rare <em>Pump it Up: The Fusion Sega Genesis</em> port, and no credit was given to the original authors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity's use of copyrighted <em>Pump it Up</em> intellectual property became an issue when it was discovered that the <em>Pump it Up: Infinity</em> mission zone recreation was actually a near exact copy/paste
                    of the actual mission zone code and graphical assets from a previously leaked development build. This led to a request issued by Team Infinity to remove any and all <em>Pump it Up</em> branding and intellectual property from the game, on behalf of Andamiro.
                    The team was given the option to continue the PumpSanity project without this content, but they decided instead to discontinue the project of their own volition.
                    There was originally planned to be a Linux-compatible build, including Phoenix scoring, but this would never be released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Disclosure:</strong> I have had multiple personal run-ins with a member of the development team that were not positive, where past criticisms I made (i.e. describing inaccuracies, versus other inaccuracies in other simulators for the sake of comparison) were misinterpreted.
                    More than once, I was pinged by this person in a private mutual Discord server with long-winded berating messages, phrased in such a way as to suggest that I was intentionally slandering or spreading misinformation about this project, which was not my intention.
                    As a result, I am biased against using this project myself, and cannot in good faith recommend it to others.

                    It is an expansion of the <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em>, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game, with some extra assets borrowed from later games, and some original graphics.
                    Some of the minor issues in StepP1 were fixed, including hold timing being made more accurate to arcade versions through hex editing.
                    The theme and contents have also been decrypted, and are freely modifiable.

                    <strong>As of July 31, 2025, piulin has made the difficult decision to shut down piured out of respect for Andamiro's release of <a href="#PIURISE"><span class="attn-label">PUMP IT UP: R!SE</span></a>.</strong>
                    This decision was his own, and Andamiro was not involved. Massive respect to piulin for everything he gave the community. Despite being deprecated, this section will remain here for the sake of posterity.

                <p>
                    piured is a web-based simulator that runs <strong>entirely within your browser!</strong>
                    It's the first of its kind, in that it was developed from the ground up without using StepMania, and without relying on borrowed source code from official games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does require an account to get started, but you can sign up directly on the webpage. It includes the vast majority of official songs, plus a few customs.
                    There may be a small amount of content missing here or there, but piulin is very receptive to feedback; contact him if anything is missing!
                    There are daily challenges available, where you can compete for a spot on the in-game leaderboard against other worldwide players, and you can check out content that's currently trending among the playerbase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    piured is <strong>recommended</strong> for anyone who wants to just jump right in and play without installing or downloading large amounts of content, and it's <strong>actively maintained</strong>!

                <p>
                    Different song packs are split into individual ROMs due to filesize limitations, but each ROM can contain plenty of songs.
                    There are three types of ROMs: <strong>Campaign</strong>, <strong>Arcade</strong>, and <strong>Impossible</strong>.
                    Campaign mode is kind of like mission zone, with unlock conditions for different songs. Arcade mode has all songs available for free play.
                    Impossible mode throws fast-paced songs with hard to read modifiers at you, like blurring the screen and moving the notefield around.

                <p>
                    Rave it Out is meant to be more of a standalone game of its own, rather than a Pump simulator.
                    It has its own unique theme and features, timing windows, lifebar mechanics, scoring, and grading, and runs on a custom build of the StepMania engine, called SM-RIO.
                    The game itself is themed around & prominently features North American pop music, but the engine has support built in for the StepF2 simfile standard, and can play most official converts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rave it Out is <strong>unique!</strong> It's <strong>unmaintained</strong> because it's essentially a finished project, for now.
                    It's a lot of fun, and it feels polished and well made. There isn't really much else like it.
                    Give it a shot if you're ever itching to change it up a bit and play for accuracy and score, or want to listen to something out of the ordinary.

                    FiveSteps is a Pump simulator for Android devices!
                    I can't speak for this one personally, as I haven't used it before, but the project looks fantastic visually, and I've spoken to players who have very much enjoyed it.
                    If you're looking to play PIU on the go, this is probably the next best thing from the official mobile game, which is long since discontinued.

                    I'm not sure how accurate FiveSteps' simulation of official arcade mechanics is. If anyone does know and/or has some sources for their information, please let me know and I'll update this entry!

                        That's the best part - there isn't! Every simulator has its own quirks, and everyone has their own preferences for what they're willing to sacrifice for the features they want.
                        Below are <strong>my personal recommendations</strong> based on both my own experiences, and the options I have seen others choose using the information available to them.
                        Keep in mind, there's nothing stopping you from trying more than one out to see what you think!

                    <p>
                        "Simfile" can be a pretty loose term, but for our purposes, we can define a simfile as a file containing all of the chart data and metadata for a song.
                        This metadata includes all of the surface level information about a song (title, author, etc.), as well as paths to graphics, background/preview videos, and audio files for a single song.
                        One simfile can contain several charts. Simfiles are pretty much always accompanied by audio and graphics files. Collections of songs are released as simfile packs.
                        Here's an example of a typical simfile structure, using <em>BRAIN POWER</em> from the <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> simfile pack released by <em>The Resistance Simfiles</em>:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <div class="codebox">

                        Something important to keep in mind is that <strong>simfile layouts are very arbitrary.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It <strong>doesn't really matter</strong> what most of the files are called, aside from the extension, and <strong>not all of these have to be present.</strong>
                        As long as there's a file that ends with ".ssc" that defines a path to a valid audio file, the simulator will recognize it and display it on the song select screen.-
                        The majority of simfiles only include a handful of files, namely the SSC file itself, alongside a single background image, preview video, background video, and audio file.
                        Simfiles from packs like the ones released by <em>The Resistance</em> are meant to be accurate to their arcade counterparts, and include song IDs that are as accurate as possible, to ensure they're sorted in the same order.
                        Custom simfiles don't always try to adhere to this convention.

                        Simulators support a variety of formats. Support differs slightly between many simulators, and some formats are generally preferred over others. Here's an overview.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Simfiles</h3>

                                <span class="attn-label">SSC</span> <span class="label-green">Recommended</span><br/>
                                The modern and most widely used simfile format. Developed by the Spinal Shark Collective for "sm-ssc", which eventually becamse StepMania 5.
                                The SSC format has several revisions used for different simulators.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">SM</span> <span class="label-blue">Outdated</span><br/>
                                The original simfile format used by StepMania in the early days, before sm-ssc. Much more limited and restricted than the SSC format.
                                Used mainly for older games, like the <em>Pump it Up: PRO</em> series, which was built on StepMania 4 and used this format.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">AMX</span> <span class="label-red">Not Recommended</span><br/>
                                Made for StepMania AMX, a spinoff of StepMania 3.9 made by AldoMX.
                                There isn't really a reason to use this anymore, but it's supported by select newer simulators, including StepF2/StepP1 and PumpSanity.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">KSF</span> <span class="label-red">Not Recommended</span><br/>
                                Made for <em>Kick it Up</em>, the first known <em>Pump it Up</em> simulator developed and released from 1999 to 2001.
                                <em>Kick it Up</em> was technically an official project, developed by (at the time) members of the PIU development team! VERY outdated though, just including this because it's neat.
                                StepF2/StepP1 support it, if you ever stumble across files for it!<br/>

                                <span class="attn-label">UCS</span> <span class="label-orange">Limited</span><br/>
                                Not technically a simfile. UCS is a format used by official <em>Pump it Up</em> arcade titles, and stands for "User Custom Step."
                                It's a very limited format, only really allowing for note placement and BPM changes. Included because most modern simulators technically support it.<br/>

                                <span class="attn-label">OGG</span> <span class="label-green">Recommended</span><br/>
                                An open, non-proprietary, patent/royalty-free compressed format. Highly recommended, due to widespread support and a lack of licensing/usage fees. Used in StepMania-based arcade games, like <em>In the Groove</em>.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">MP3</span> <span class="label-orange">Not Recommended</span><br/>
                                A proprietary, compressed format. Licensing, especially for commercial projects, is very restrictive. Size:Quality ratio is generally worse than OGG. Commonly used because of how well-known it is, but not recommeded.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">WAV</span> <span class="label-orange">Not Recommended</span><br/>
                                A free-to-use, uncompressed format that doesn't require a license. Because it's uncompressed, filesizes can get rather large. Doesn't really provide any advantages over OGG for anyone that isn't playing exclusively with audiophile equipment.<br/>

                                <span class="attn-label">MPEG2</span><br/>
                                The most widely used codec, generally found in .mpg containers. Works the most consistly across all simulators.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="attn-label">MPEG4</span><br/>
                                More modern than MPEG2 and still widely used, generally found in .mp4 containers. Compatibility is hit or miss.
                                For example, it tends to drift offsync in StepF2/StepP1/StepP1+ but plays back normally in Project OutFox.<br/>

                                <span class="attn-label">AVI</span><br/>
                                An uncompressed format. Widely supported, but MASSIVE in filesize. Not recommended due to size.<br/>

                                An compressed, lossless format. One of the two most widely used.
                                Generally larger in size, but not enough to make a difference as long as you aren't bundling in unnecessarily large images.<br/>

                                <span class="attn-label">JPG</span><br/>
                                A compressed, lossy format. One of the two most widely used.
                                Very efficient on file size, without noticeable visual artifacts in most cases.<br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                An uncompressed, lossless format.
                                Contains its own colour palette for each individual image. Because each pixel is stored individually, filesizes can get quite large. Supported, but honestly just use PNG/JPG.<br/>

                <h3 class="body-header">SSC Versions</h3>
                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        This is a whole can of worms that I'll be getting into eventually. I'm leaving this as a stub for now until I have time to look further into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, the gist of it is that <strong>different simulators may use different revisions</strong> of the SSC format.
                        For example, StepF2 uses SSC version <strong>0.81</strong>, which is a version with slightly different behavior and specifications that was made and implemented for StepF2 by xMAx.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some simulators, like Project OutFox, rely on this #VERSION tag to tell the engine how to interpret the chart, and whether it needs to handle specific things a specific way.
                        StepF2 charts would not play back as expected in OutFox if the version number is not properly specified, because it's programmed to read StepF2 charts a little diferently from other "pump" charts.
                    </p>
                </span>

                <h2 class="body-header">Background Videos (BGAs)</h2>
                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        Background videos, also known as BGAs, can sometimes trip up people who are new to simulation and/or charting.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My songs don't have BGAs! How can I add them?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The answer to this one is a little complicated - <strong>it depends on the simfiles.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many simfile packs, such as the ones from <em>The Resistance Simfiles</em>, bundle the BGAs as part of a separate download.
                        StepF2 and StepP1 simfiles also offer their BGAs as a separate download, which can be found on the official website.
                        If the pack you use doesn't offer a separate download, it may be a lot more labour intensive to get them working; you may have to individually download BGAs online, and manually define and sync them in the SSCs by hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to retrace your steps back to where you got your files, and see whether or not they have a separate download available.
                        If so, you will likely have to download and <strong>extract the videos to the SongMovies folder</strong>.
                        This folder should be present in the root of the simulator's install directory, beside the Songs folder.
                        <strong>If you do not have a SongMovies folder,</strong> you can make it yourself and extract the files to it and it should work fine, it's nothing fancy!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do I need BGAs? Can I remove them?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A common question is quether or not BGAs are necessary, and whether they can be deleted to save space.
                        <strong>Typically, yes! You can delete BGAs</strong> if they take up too much room, and they are not a necessity to keep around.
                        The majority of simulators have a default background animation or graphic that they display when dedicated files are not defined or present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most official simfiles <strong>store their BGAs in the SongMovies folder.</strong>
                        If you're looking to free up some space, you can remove most of these - just <strong>do not remove Black.mpg</strong> or any equivalent!
                        Other simfiles include their BGAs directly with the simfiles themselves, present in the same directory as the SSC file and such.
                        These can also be deleted to free up space, but if you decide to do this, it's also a good idea to edit the SSC file directly in a text editor to remove any references to these files too.

                    <p>
                        Every once in a while you might encounter a simfile that contains .lua files. Lua is the scripting language used by StepMania for just about everything that isn't the engine itself.
                        In this case, the Lua files present in simfiles contain scripted modifiers that can do just about anything, from recreating effects found in official <am>Pump it Up</em> charts, to creating entire minigames within the chart!
                        One of my favourite examples ever of this is <em>Mawaru Infinity</em>, which was one of my first introductions to PIU as a whole:

                    <p>

                        Unfortunately, Pump simfiles are rather hard to come by nowadays. It's very difficult to compile a comprehensive list on a site like this, because of how spread out it all is.
