                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        In terms of rhythm games, a <strong>simulator</strong> is a program that <strong>simulates</strong> the gameplay loop and mechanics of a given game.
                        Simulators are generally free to play, and can either look entirely unique, or can visually resemble the game they're made to simulate.
                    </p>
                </span>

                <h1 class="body-header">Drawbacks of Using a Simulator</h1>
                <span class="boxdy-text">
                    <p>
                        Simulators are built from the ground up to resemble the gameplay and mirror the core mechanics of a particular game.
                        They're rarely (if ever) perfect, and most have noticeable flaws that can detract from the experience. <strong>This is true of all simulators.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to Pump it Up simulators specifically, the question of chart accuracy also comes into play. Most charts <strong>from 1st Dance Floor</strong> up to and <strong>including PRIME 2015</strong> are <strong>decrypts</strong>.
                        Decrypt charts are near identical to the originals, as they were converted to a simfile format from decrypted data originating from the official game. Everything <strong>including and after PRIME 2 2017</strong> are <strong>recreations</strong> made by hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll go into more detail regarding simfiles, as well as particular pros and cons for each commonly used simulator, further down this page.

                        There are a ton of simulators out there, and it can get confusing.
                        Here's a (roughly) chronological list of modern, commonly used ones that you'll see mentioned frequently online. Every one has different quirks and features, which I'll be covering later.

                <p>
                    StepMania was released in 2001 as a simulator for Konami's <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> games. Over time, the codebase was expanded to add support for other gamemodes, including Pump.
                    Every other simulator listed below is built on top of some version of StepMania 5.x, with extremely thorough and heavy-handed changes to fix bugs, issues, and inaccuracies, as well as to add features not present in the base StepMania 5.x engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Base StepMania (versions 4.x through 5.x) are <strong>not recommended</strong> for Pump simulation due to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issues with hold notes and ticks not being counted or scored correctly;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heds are subject to full tap note timing windows instead of just Perfect or Miss;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heads cannot be held before reaching the receptors to count as a Perfect;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate timing window scales;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate lifebar mechanics;</li>
                    <li>A lack of support for special notetypes widely used in Pump charts for visual effects, etc;</li>
                    <li>An overall lack of maintainence regarding the "pump" gamemode, with no updates or fixes in a very long time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While custom charts made with these mechanics in mind do exist, they are exceptiomally rare, and the vast majority of players are not looking for this playstyle.
                    <strong>Chart files made for other StepMania-based simulators will technically play</strong> in this engine, but <strong>they will not work correctly.</strong>
                    <strong>Most official chart conversions are not playable</strong> on this engine.

                <p>
                    StepF2 is the first major modern Pump simulator to have been released.
                    It is an accurate recreation of Pump it Up: Fiesta 2, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game.
                    For many years, it was the most popular and widely used simulator available, and it defined the chart format still used by most modern simulators today.
                    You basically have StepF2 to thank for the existence of most other modern simulators and content!
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepF2 is <strong>playable</strong>, performs well, and still holds up, but is <strong>deprecated</strong>, as it has been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1">StepP1</a> (which has, in turn, been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1+">StepP1+</a>).
