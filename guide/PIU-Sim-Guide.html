                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        In terms of rhythm games, a <strong>simulator</strong> is a program that <strong>simulates</strong> the gameplay loop and mechanics of a given game.
                        Simulators are generally free to play, and can either look entirely unique, or can visually resemble the game they're made to simulate.

                <h1 class="body-header">Drawbacks of Using a Simulator</h1>
                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        Simulators are built from the ground up to resemble the gameplay and mirror the core mechanics of a particular game.
                        They're rarely (if ever) perfect, and most have noticeable flaws that can detract from the experience. <strong>This is true of all simulators.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to Pump it Up simulators specifically, the question of chart accuracy also comes into play. Most charts <strong>from 1st Dance Floor</strong> up to and <strong>including PRIME 2015</strong> are <strong>decrypts</strong>.
                        Decrypt charts are near identical to the originals, as they were converted to a simfile format from decrypted data originating from the official game. Everything <strong>including and after PRIME 2 2017</strong> are <strong>recreations</strong> made by hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll go into more detail regarding simfiles, as well as particular pros and cons for each commonly used simulator, further down this page.

                        There are a ton of simulators out there, and it can get confusing.
                        Here's a (roughly) chronological list of modern, commonly used ones that you'll see mentioned frequently online. Every one has different quirks and features, which I'll be covering later.

                    StepMania was released in 2001 as a simulator for Konami's <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> games. Over time, the codebase was expanded to add support for other gamemodes, including Pump.
                    Every other simulator listed below is built on top of some version of StepMania 5.x, with extremely thorough and heavy-handed changes to fix bugs, issues, and inaccuracies, as well as to add features not present in the base StepMania 5.x engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Base StepMania (versions 4.x through 5.x) are <strong>not recommended</strong> for Pump simulation due to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issues with hold notes and ticks not being counted or scored correctly;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heds are subject to full tap note timing windows instead of just Perfect or Miss;</li>
                    <li>Incorrect hold note mechanics, where hold heads cannot be held before reaching the receptors to count as a Perfect;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate timing window scales;</li>
                    <li>A lack of accurate lifebar mechanics;</li>
                    <li>A lack of support for special notetypes widely used in Pump charts for visual effects, etc;</li>
                    <li>An overall lack of maintainence regarding the "pump" gamemode, with no updates or fixes in a very long time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While custom charts made with these mechanics in mind do exist, they are exceptiomally rare, and the vast majority of players are not looking for this playstyle.
                    <strong>Chart files made for other StepMania-based simulators will technically play</strong> in this engine, but <strong>they will not work correctly.</strong>
                    <strong>Most official chart conversions are not playable</strong> on this engine.

                    StepF2 is the first major modern Pump simulator to have been released.
                    It is an accurate recreation of Pump it Up: Fiesta 2, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game.
                    For many years, it was the most popular and widely used simulator available, and it defined the chart format still used by most modern simulators today.
                    You basically have StepF2 to thank for the existence of most other modern simulators and content!

                <p>
                    StepF2 is <strong>playable</strong>, performs well, and still holds up, but is <strong>deprecated</strong>, as it has been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1">StepP1</a> (which has, in turn, been surpassed by <a href="#StepP1+">StepP1+</a>).

                    StepPrime is weird. There are a lot of rumors to how this one started and where it originated. There are a lot of different projects that called themselves "StepPrime" and the history is really muddled. This will be <strong>focusing on the StepPrime released by the late PumpSanity team.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know if StepPrime ever made it past the early alpha stage, but from my experience, it was very buggy and incomplete, though it's been long enough that I don't remember the specifics.
                    It was functional, but definitely not the ideal experience. Most people I've talked to who tried it had a similar experience.
                    It's easy enough to find references to it floating around the internet that I figure it's worth a mention in this list, but it's not worth seeking out.

                    Infinitesimal is a theme for the <a href="https://projectoutfox.com/" target="_blank">Project OutFox</a> engine, formerly known as StepMania 5.3.
                    The visual style is inspired heavily by Pump it Up: Infinity, and the base game itself does not include any <em>Pump it Up</em> branding or copyrighted content.
                    I started developing Infinitesimal in May of 2020.
                    It gained traction over time as more contributors jumped on board, and as OutFox improved the "pump" gamemode engine, ironing out bugs and implementing new features.
                    The project aims to recreate as much Pump functionality as possible plus tons of extra goodies, including but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arcade-accurate, asymmetrical timing</li>
                    <li>All timing window options available in PIU, plus extras</li>
                    <li>Arcade-accurate lifebar with overflow</li>
                    <li>Several types of speed mods, including arcade-accurate AV</li>
                    <li>Options for classic or Phoenix-style scoring, letter grades & plates</li>

                    StepP1 is the official successor to <a href="#StepF2">StepF2</a>.
                    It is a mostly accurate recreation of <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em>, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game.
                    StepP1 was never fully completed and lacks features like basic mode, but being a continuation of StepF2's already rock solid engine, it holds up well and gameplay is very accurate.
                    It only received one release, and is no longer being developed or maintained. There will be no future updates released by the original developer.

                <h1 class="body-header">StepPXX</h1>
                <p><span class="label-red">Deprecated</span></p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX is the successor to <a href="#StepPrime">StepPrime</a>, developed by the late PumpSanity team, made to resemble <em>Pump it Up: XX 20th Anniversary Edition</em>.
                    Not to be confused with StepXX, a different simulator also meant to resemble <em>Pump it Up: XX</em>, but never made it past extremely early development and was never quite playable.
                    <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> has not been decrypted, and the graphics used are a mix of hand recreations and cropped sections from other media.
                    Many sound effects and menu tracks don't quite line up, or suffer from poor audio quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX received infrequent updates and never really made it past the "early preview" stage, with a permanent watermark on the upper left corner.
                    There were some attempts to implement an online matching feature, but it seems they were limited to a private build that was only distributed selectively, and I'm not sure it got a public release.
                    StepPXX introduced a <strong>new simfile format</strong>, which accounted for some new modifiers that StepP1 did not support, but which rarely see widespread use.
                    This new simfile format is an SSC versoin that is <strong>not compatible with StepP1</strong> or any simulators made to use StepP1 simfiles, which pushed StepPXX simfiles into their own separate branch of the simulator community,
                    starting a content accessibility divide that is still present today. Performance is also subpar on lower end machines, due to the security and encryption features present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first widespread simulator to include support for Mission or Quest zones from older mainline <em>Pump it Up</em> games,
                    including the mission zones from <em>Pump it Up: Infinity</em> and <em>Fiesta EX</em>, and WorldMax from <em>Pump it Up NXA</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other simulators themed around official releases, <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> was still actively supported and sold by Andamiro during the time of this project's release.
                    Many freeplay arcades opted to install this software instead of purchasing a legitimate kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepPXX is <strong>deprecated</strong> and succeeded by <a href="#PumpSanity">PumpSanity</a>.

                       <li>Compatible with StepPXX simfiles (kinda goes without saying really)</li>
                       <li>Somewhat widespread use, due to the novelty of looking like <em>Pump it Up: XX</em></li>
                       <li>Includes most modifiers present in the <em>Pump it Up: XX</em> command window</li>
                       <li>Includes recreations of mission zones from previous <em>Pump it Up</em> titles</li>

                    Oh boy, this one's got some history. Buckle up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity is the successor to <a href="#StepPXX">StepPXX</a>, developed by the late PumpSanity team.
                    Its main attraction is the new "original" PumpSanity theme, which is primarily a reskin of the Prime theme with some extras added on.
                    It also includes options for <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em> and <em>XX: 20th Anniversary Edition</em> themes, recycled from StepPrime and StepPXX respectively, with some fixes and improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity received infrequent updates, and some content was <strong>paywalled behind their Patreon page</strong>.
                    One big selling point for PumpSanity was its online matching feature, which differed from StepPXX's implementation by working via Discord integration, and requiring the player to be present in the official PumpSanity discord server to work.
                    This feature no longer functions, and <strong>will cause the game to crash</strong> after finishing a song unless the player either closes Discord or blocks the application in the Windows Firewall settings.
                    PumpSanity also continued and expanded upon their <strong>new simfile format</strong>, further branching off from StepF2's long-standing standard and widening the content accessibility divide; any charts made for PumpSanity will not function correctly in any other simulator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the game's built-in content was taken from the <a href="#StepF2">StepF2</a>/<a href="#StepP1">StepP1</a> projects and redistributed with minor changes to fit the new engine.
                    Other content was used without permission, such as simfile transcriptions (which I personally contributed to) meant to preserve the rare <em>Pump it Up: The Fusion Sega Genesis</em> port, and no credit was given to the original authors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PumpSanity's use of copyrighted <em>Pump it Up</em> intellectual property became an issue when it was discovered that the <em>Pump it Up: Infinity</em> mission zone recreation was actually a near exact copy/paste
                    of the actual mission zone code and graphical assets from a previously leaked development build. This led to a request issued by Team Infinity to remove any and all <em>Pump it Up</em> branding and intellectual property from the game, on behalf of Andamiro.
                    The team was given the option to continue the PumpSanity project without this content, but they decided instead to discontinue the project of their own volition.
                    There was originally planned to be a Linux-compatible build, including Phoenix scoring, but this would never be released.

                    It is an expansion of the <em>Pump it Up: PRIME 2015</em>, using decrypted graphics and audio ripped from the official game, with some extra assets borrowed from later games, and some original graphics.
                    Some of the minor issues in StepP1 were fixed, including hold timing being made more accurate to arcade versions through hex editing.
                    The theme and contents have also been decrypted, and are freely modifiable.
