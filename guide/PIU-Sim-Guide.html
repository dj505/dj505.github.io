                <span class="body-text">
                    <p>
                        In terms of rhythm games, a <strong>simulator</strong> is a program that <strong>simulates</strong> the gameplay loop and mechanics of a given game.
                        Simulators are generally free to play, and can either look entirely unique, or can visually resemble the game they're made to simulate.

                <span class="boxdy-text">
                    <p>
                        Simulators are built from the ground up to resemble the gameplay and mirror the core mechanics of a particular game.
                        They're rarely (if ever) perfect, and most have noticeable flaws that can detract from the experience. <strong>This is true of all simulators.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to Pump it Up simulators specifically, the question of chart accuracy also comes into play. Most charts <strong>from 1st Dance Floor</strong> up to and <strong>including PRIME 2015</strong> are <strong>decrypts</strong>.
                        Decrypt charts are near identical to the originals, as they were converted to a simfile format from decrypted data originating from the official game. Everything <strong>including and after PRIME 2 2017</strong> are <strong>recreations</strong> made by hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll go into more detail regarding simfiles, as well as particular pros and cons for each commonly used simulator, further down this page.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Remember:</h3>

                        There are a ton of simulators out there, and it can get confusing.
                        Here's a (roughly) chronological list of modern, commonly used ones that you'll see mentioned frequently online. Every one has different quirks and features, which I'll be covering later.
