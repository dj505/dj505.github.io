                        I've got a few nodes set up here and there to serve different purposes, and I'll be talking about the hardware a little bit here!
                        None of it is anything super fancy, but I think it's neat!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only a couple of my nodes have location information set, and they're all specific coordinates entered by hand with accuracy turned <strong>wayyyyy</strong> down for privacy reasons.
                        Any maps my nodes may show up in do not reflect anywhere near their actual location, and are for extremely-vague-range-test-reference-number reasons only!

                        My primary EDC node is a super low-cost nRF52 <a href="https://github.com/gargomoma/fakeTec_pcb">fakeTec</a> node, based on a clone nice!nano MCU coupled with an SX1262 HT-RA62 module.
                        It's got a 3000mAh battery and an M5Stack CardKB module for sending messages completely standalone, all housed in my <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1274135-minimesh-standalone-faketec-messenger-node"><strong>Minimesh</strong> case</a>!
                        Battery life lasts roughly 2 weeks between charges, and it'll fit just about any SMA antenna I have on hand, though it's currently using a LINX ANT-916, which I've found to be pretty solid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This node tends to stay in my pocket or bag most of the time! While I'm at work I'll have it up high on a shelf for better reception.

                        At home, I keep a Heltec V3 running, hooked up to my PC at all times, connected to <a href="https://affirmatech.com/meshsense">Meshsense!</a>
                        This node monitors connections between nodes on the mesh and provides data to the <a href="https://meshsense.affirmatech.com/">global MeshSense map!</a>

                        This node uses a GIZONT 17cm antenna from AliExpress, which was recommended by the community, and I've had good results with it.

                        I've been slowly but steadily putting together a solar node setup, with the most affordable parts I can find.
                        It's still a major work in progress, so if you're reading this paragraph as-is, it's probably not totally accurate anymore!
                        What I can say for certain won't change, though, is that the radio hardware is extremely similar to my <a href="#edc">EDC node.</a>
                        It runs on an nRF52 <a href="https://github.com/gargomoma/fakeTec_pcb">fakeTec</a> and SX1262 HT-RA62 module combo again,
                        with a BME280 temperature/humidity sensor, and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006806330654.html">this particular cheap 5v regulated solar panel</a> from AliExpress.
                        To keep it weatherproof, I used an SMA pigtail connector I had laying around which I previously bought by mistake for a portable node.
                        The base was way too large to fit the shell, but that's because it has a rubber o-ring built in! Perfect for drilling into the side of a plastic box.
                        However, for the next revision I'm moving to an N-female connector instead, which is a bit more fit for outdoor use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The antenna I plan to use with the new N-female connector is an ALFA AOA-915-5ACM, which I'm still waiting on as of writing this.
                        However, it's currently using <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006833587735.html">this particular articulating antenna</a> I found on AliExpress.
                        It's not amazing, and if you want a cheap antenna from AliExpress you're probably better off with a GIZONT whip antenna,
                        but I made the (regrettable) decision to mount the SMA connector on the side of the box, forcing me to bend it up at a 90 degree angle.
