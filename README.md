## About Me
My name is Jayden, and I'm an arcade technician by trade. I also dabble in **graphic design**, **programming**, **game dev**, **electronics**, and **PCB design!**

A lot of my projects are centered around arcade rhythm games, in particular Andamiro's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)">Pump it Up</a></em> series. 

## Noteworthy Projects
Here's some of the stuff I've done!

- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/Infinitesimal">Infinitesimal</a>: a theme for the Project OutFox rhythm game engine, written in Lua, to closely simulate <em>Pump it Up</em> gameplay. 4+ years in the making. Graphics & overall design by yours truly!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/PicoLX">PicoLX</a>: an RP2040-based keyboard-style custom controller for <em>Pump it Up</em>-style rhythm games!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/TechnoPico">TechnoPico</a>: an even more advanced 18-button keyboard-style controller for any arcade-style dance game, based on the RP2354!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/BusinessCard">Business Card</a>: a functional PCB business card, containing a 4x4 key matrix, compatible with QMK. This might even be what brought you here! :eyes:
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/Pad-Light-Kit">Overkill Pad Light Kit</a>: a custom, animated lighting board for almost any arcade dance pad, powered by the RP2040, with a 5x5 matrix of WS2812B LEDs. Can communicate with other panels over RS485!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/low-key-amuse">Low-Key-Amuse</a>: a custom capacitive touch e-amusement keypad based on the MPR121, built for <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> machines but compatible with most Bemani machines! Made in collaboration with <a href="https://planetclue.com">planet clue</a>!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/Clipboard">Clipboard</a>: a tiny macropad with a built-in OLED screen based on the Pimoroni Tiny2040, made to make copy/pasting faster and easier!
- <a href="https://github.com/dj505/ArrowTracker">ArrowTracker</a>: a website built on Python/Flask, built to learn a bit of webe development. Made to track <em>Pump it Up</em> scores and progression!
