## About Me
<img src="/assets/logo.jpg" align="left" width="200px"/>
My name is Jayden, and I'm an arcade technician by trade. I also dabble in <strong>graphic design</strong>, <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>game dev</strong>, <strong>electronics</strong>, and <strong>PCB design.</strong> I've even had a coupe projects sponsored by PCBWay!
<br><br>
A lot of my projects are centered around arcade rhythm games, in particular Andamiro's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)">Pump it Up</a></em> series. I also have a strong passion for arcade games & hardware, retro consoles (collection, restoration, and modding), mechanical keyboards, and more! In addition, I've been working with 3D printers for over a decade, and have owned a little CNC machine for a couple years, which I mess around with every once in a while. I also dabble in Python and Lua scripting, with a side of embedded C/C++ for microcontrollers, and I've been working with Adobe tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects for many years.

### Q&A
<details>
  <summary>Questions? Answers!</summary>

- <strong>Q:</strong> Where are you from?
  - <strong>A:</strong> Canada!
- <strong>Q:</strong> Is it really that cold there?
  - <strong>A:</strong> Sometimes! Winters can be nasty. Summers are warmer than most people think.
- <strong>Q:</strong> How long have you been playing dance games?
  - <strong>A:</strong> Since at least 2016! It might be even earlier, but it's hard to say.
- <strong>Q:</strong> What do you use to design your PCBs?
  - <strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCAD!</a> It's free and open source, and as intimidating as it looks, it's very easy to learn.
- <strong>Q:</strong> What resources do you recommend for learning?
  - <strong>A:</strong> I started with <a href="https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design">ai03's design guide</a>! It's made with mechanical keyboard in mind, but it takes you through all the fundamentals for just about any project.
- <strong>Q:</strong> Do you sell your projects?
  - <strong>A:</strong> Generally yes, but in small quantities! I only really do small batches since it's all I can afford. Please feel free to reach out if you're interested!
