                        My name is Jayden, and I'm an arcade technician by trade. I also dabble in <strong>graphic design</strong>, <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>game dev</strong>, <strong>electronics</strong>, and <strong>PCB design.</strong> I've even had a couple projects sponsored by PCBWay!</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of my projects are centered around arcade rhythm games, in particular Andamiro's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)">Pump it Up</a></em> series. I also have a strong passion for arcade games & hardware, retro consoles (collection, restoration, and modding), mechanical keyboards, and more! In addition, I've been working with 3D printers for over a decade, and have owned a little CNC machine for a couple years, which I mess around with every once in a while. I also dabble in Python and Lua scripting, with a side of embedded C/C++ for microcontrollers, and I've been working with Adobe tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects for many years.</span>

                        If you found this site via me yelling into the void through one of my Meshtastic nodes, hello!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mesh over here isn't very active or consistent right now, and I don't get very good signal strength in the areas I'm usually in.
                        So, if you've received a message of mine and visited this site out of curiosity, please feel free to shoot me an email or reach out on Discord!
                        I always appreciate knowing if the things I'm broadcasting go through as I test different equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meshtastic, for those who are new to it, is a long-distance off-grid mesh network messaging protocol using low-cost LoRa radio devices!
                        Check out <a href="https://meshtastic.org">the Meshtastic website</a> for more info. Definitely recommend giving it a shot, it's a lot of fun!
